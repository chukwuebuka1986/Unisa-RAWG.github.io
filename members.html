My science interests include, but not limited to, masers in Galactic star-forming region, astrometry, radio galaxies, Galaxy Clusters, FRBs, and high fidelity imaging with sensitive radio interferometers (ALMA, VLA, MeerKAT) and VLBI. I currently chair the Science Committee of the African Astronomical Society (AfAS), and I am a member of the Users Committee of South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) and enhanced Multi Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN)steering committee member.

                                    <p>Catherine Cress grew up in Johannesburg and completed her BSc Honours degree in Theoretical Physics (with distinction) at the University of Cape Town. Her PhD in Astrophysics from Columbia University involved studies of galaxies and cosmology using data from radio telescopes. She carried out research at Cambridge University and the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics before returning to South Africa to build the Astronomy groups at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, the University of the Western Cape and at the Centre for High Performance Computing. She obtained a P-rating from the National Research Foundation and was awarded the Silver Jubilee medal by the SA Institute of Physics. She dedicated many years to making Astronomy relevant to the world: through work as a Data Science consultant in industry, by establishing an Astronomy tourism business and by teaching in schools. At the end of 2024, eager to return to Astrophysics research, she took up the Professorship at UNISA and is looking forward to exploiting UNISA’s successful distance learning model to help grow Astronomy in Africa. She is a member of the Square Kilometre Array working group on Cosmology and plans to use data to probe the nature of dark energy as well as test Einstein’s theory of General Relativity.<br>

Started my career as a solid-state physicist, obtaining a PhD in electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy from the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, and working as a research scientist for De Beers Industrial Diamonds. Then progressed into the corporate world, resulting in a successful and rewarding business career. I have spent the past several years as an astronomer fulfilling a passion for research. I am currently working with Derck Smits looking at maser flaring and polarisation – we have several projects using the Green Bank Telescope investigating polarisation of excited OH masers.<br>

I am also interested in reverberation mapping studies of quasars. I am involved in a study to improve the teaching of astronomy to the public and potentially extend that to teachers. This will hopefully improve the appreciation that the general public has of the investment the government has made into astronomy.<br>

                                    <p>Hi! My name is Sthabile. I am a radio astronomer whose main research interests center around two overarching topics (i) active galactic nuclei (AGN) and (ii) source populations selected by deep extragalactic radio surveys. Currently, I am carrying out much of this research as a member of the MeerKAT Large Survey Project working group MIGHTEE, superMIGHTEE (MIGHTEE + commensal uGMRT observations), and LOFAR collaborations. I am also involved in efforts to develop anomaly detection software pipelines for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory / LSST. Since 2014, I have casually played classical and acoustic guitar. I recently began taking lessons to improve. When time permits, I enjoy playing for relaxation and self-expression. I enjoying singing from time to time as well. I currently reside in South Africa - a country with many gorgeous landscapes, where I am spoilt for choice of outdoor places to savour.<br>

                                    <p> I got my PhD in Astronomy from UCT in 1990 on the topic of "Atomic Processes in Nova Shells".  From 1990 - 1998 I worked at the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO) where I was part of the spectroscopy group doing observations mainly on excited OH masers. In Feb 1998 I moved to Unisa where I was head of the astronomy section of the Dept of Mathematics until I retired at the end of 2019. I am still involved with colleagues doing research on modelling of nebular gases, masers in star-forming regions and W UMa contact binary stars. In my spare time, I spend time in game reserves photographing animals and birds, and then a lot more time editing the digital photos.<br>

As a member of the IAU, URSI, and AfAS, my research focuses on star formation, with a particular emphasis on massive stars using Maser emission. I also investigate stellar variability, particularly in eclipsing binaries. Beyond academia, I am passionate about science communication and engaging the public with scientific discoveries. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, ping pong, and traveling.<br>

                                    <p>My passion for Astronomy started while viewing Halley’s Comet one evening in Van Stadensrus, Free State, with my grandfather. This whitish speck with its short tail etched on a dusk sky, sparked a love and awe for the heaven’s indescribable beauty and magnificence of Creation. To understand a tiny bit about these wonderful objects, I thus completed BSc (Mathematics and Theoretical Physics), BSc (Hons) (Astronomy) and MSc (Astronomy) (all 3 cum laude) via Unisa. For the more earthly matters, I acquired a BBA (Unisa). I am also a member of SAIP. My interests are in the analysis of light curves of variable stars, evolution and modeling of contact binary stars (WUMa), stellar evolution, space and terrestrial weather. In my spare time, I enjoy the company of my 4-legged friends and classic music.<br>

                                    <p>My research interest is in massive young stellar objects (YSOs) and radio astronomy. Studying massive YSOs can provide valuable insights into the early stages of star formation and the evolution of stellar systems. Radio astronomy helps to observe the cold, dense regions where these objects form, as well as the energetic processes associated with their birth and early development. Exploring the radio emission from massive YSOs can help unravel the complex physical processes involved in their formation, accretion, and interaction with their surroundings. It's an exciting area of research with potential implications for our understanding of star formation, the evolution of galaxies, and the formation of planetary systems. <br>

                                    <p>I completed my Bachelors in Science (Physics and Astronomy) from the University Of Nigeria, Nsukka. I was awarded the Pan African and Planetary Science Mobility Scholarship in 2023 to pursue a MastersDegree in Astronomy at the Copperbelt University in Zambia. My current work basically focuses on Regions of high-mass star formation within the milky way galaxy using the ALMA /MEERKAT data. I am also interested in Masers being a tool for observation. I hope to pursue a career in academia which will involve active research. I am a strong believer of the African dream. In the near future, I shall delve deeper into the world of radio astronomy. I play and watch soccer during my spare time.<br>
