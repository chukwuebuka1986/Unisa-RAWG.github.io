My science interests include, but not limited to, masers in Galactic star-forming region, astrometry, radio galaxies, Galaxy Clusters, FRBs, and high fidelity imaging with sensitive radio interferometers (ALMA, VLA, MeerKAT) and VLBI. I currently chair the Science Committee of the African Astronomical Society (AfAS), and I am a member of the Users Committee of South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) and enhanced Multi Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN)steering committee member. I supervise and co-supervise dozens of MSc and PhD students in South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Taiwan, Japan, Ethiopia and Nigeria. Besides astronomy, I love to play soccer and play with my wife and kids.<br>

I am also interested in reverberation mapping studies of quasars. I am involved in a study to improve the teaching of astronomy to the public and potentially extend that to teachers. This will hopefully improve the appreciation that the general public has of the investment the government has made into astronomy.<br>

                                    <p> I got my PhD in Astronomy from UCT in 1990 on the topic of "Atomic Processes in Nova Shells".  From 1990 - 1998 I worked at the Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO) where I was part of the spectroscopy group doing observations mainly on excited OH masers. In Feb 1998 I moved to Unisa where I was head of the astronomy section of the Dept of Mathematics until I retired at the end of 2019. I am still involved with colleagues doing research on modelling of nebular gases, masers in star-forming regions and W UMa contact binary stars. In my spare time, I spend time in game reserves photographing animals and birds, and then a lot more time editing the digital photos.<br>

As a member of the IAU, URSI, and AfAS, my research focuses on star formation, with a particular emphasis on massive stars using Maser emission. I also investigate stellar variability, particularly in eclipsing binaries. Beyond academia, I am passionate about science communication and engaging the public with scientific discoveries.

My major research interest is star formation, especially massive star formation. The main aim of my research is to better understand the earliest evolutionary phase of high-mass star formation, using multiwavelength data, such as VLA, MeerKAT, ALMA, IRAC and Spitzer data, with primary objective of characterizing the chemical, physical and kinematic conditions of ongoing massive star formation. My other science interests include, but not limited to, masers, astrometry and cosmic rays. Presently, I am a Lecturer in the Department of Science Laboratory Technology, University of Nigeria, Nsukka and a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, College of Science, Engineering and Technology, University of South Africa. I am working on some of the ALMA cores in other to pin down the initial conditions of ongoing massive star formation and assist in supervising students. I love listening to music, watching movies and catching funs with my family and friends.<br>

                                    <p>My passion for Astronomy started while viewing Halley’s Comet one evening in Van Stadensrus, Free State, with my grandfather. This whitish speck with its short tail etched on a dusk sky, sparked a love and awe for the heaven’s indescribable beauty and magnificence of Creation. To understand a tiny bit about these wonderful objects, I thus completed BSc (Mathematics and Theoretical Physics), BSc (Hons) (Astronomy) and MSc (Astronomy) (all 3 cum laude) via Unisa. For the more earthly matters, I acquired a BBA (Unisa). I am also a member of SAIP. My interests are in the analysis of light curves of variable stars, evolution and modeling of contact binary stars (WUMa), stellar evolution, space and terrestrial weather. In my spare time, I enjoy the company of my 4-legged friends and classic music.<br>

                                    <p>My research interest is in massive young stellar objects (YSOs) and radio astronomy. Studying massive YSOs can provide valuable insights into the early stages of star formation and the evolution of stellar systems. Radio astronomy helps to observe the cold, dense regions where these objects form, as well as the energetic processes associated with their birth and early development. Exploring the radio emission from massive YSOs can help unravel the complex physical processes involved in their formation, accretion, and interaction with their surroundings. It's an exciting area of research with potential implications for our understanding of star formation, the evolution of galaxies, and the formation of planetary systems. <br>

                                    <p>I have a BEd Science Hons (First Class) in Mathematics and Physics, and I'm currently in my second year of MSc Physics at Meru University of Science & Technology (MUST), Meru, Kenya. Supernova remnants are my area of research interest. Apart from astronomy, I also enjoy watching movies and soccer. <br>

                                    <p>I completed my Bachelor of Science Honours Degree in Applied Physics at the National University of Science and Technology (Zimbabwe) in 2022. In 2023 I was awarded the Pan African Planetary and Science Network (PAPSSN) scholarship to pursue a master’s degree in Astrophysics at The Copperbelt University in Zambia, which I will hopefully complete in 2025. My science interest is mainly the applications of machine learning solving astrophysics problems. During My spare time I like playing chess and going out with my friends. <br>

                                    <p>I obtained a Master's degree in Physics specializing in astrophysics and astronomy at the university of Antananarivo, Madagascar. My scientific research interests include Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), radio galaxies, star clusters, star formation and multi wavelength astronomy. I'm a member of the African Astronomical Society (AfAS) and was a DARA student in the past. I enjoy singing, swimming, and reading novels in my free time.<br>

                                    <p>I have a Bachelor of Technology in Physics from the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Nigeria. As an undergraduate, I worked on renewable energy, however, my love for the electromagnetic spectrum drew my attention to Astronomy/Astrophysics. Currently, I am working on "High Resolution Radio Continuum and Spectral line study of Massive Proto-Stellar Objects" with emphasis on masers as an important observational tool. I love masers and star formation a lot, and would love to delve more into knowing them better. I am also interested in Machine Learning as it concerns astrophysics. <br>
